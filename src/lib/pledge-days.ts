 * Unpaid pledges, one row per day they were recorded on.

 * The overview and the receipts ledger need the same four figures over a
 * period: what is still owed, how many pledges there are, how many have
 * brought in nothing yet, and how many still owe something. Both used to
 * fetch up to 1000 raw unpaid rows and derive those on the client, which meant
 * switching between the two tabs re-sent the same 1000 rows to compute the
 * same numbers twice. Aggregated in the database, the payload is one row per
 * day that has pledges on it — the same trick receipt_daily_totals already
 * plays for money in.
 *
 * `cache()` for the same reason getUser has it: two callers in one render
 * would otherwise ask twice.
 *
 * The fallback is not defensive padding. Migrations here are run by hand in
 * the Supabase dashboard, so code can reach production before migration 18
 * does; without it, that window is a broken overview and a broken ledger
 * rather than a slower one. Being wrong the other way costs one round trip on
 * a query that was about to run anyway. The two paths are held to the same
 * numbers by pledge-aggregate.test.ts.
